This is a simple node.js base64 encoder/decoder
to use it make shure that you have node.js installd if not you can install it here https://nodejs.org/en/ then unzip ehter download the release or the code
once its downloded unzip the files and then start ether the encoder or decoder .bat file

These are the default locations
encoder: decoder\encoder
decoder: decoder\decoder

the code only works for txt files but you can try to use a other file by changer the impour/output location in this code

```
const inputFile = './encoder/input.txt';
const outputFile = './encoder/output.txt';
```
(do the same thing for the decoder)
