# open-base64-encoder
This is a simple node.js base64 encoder/decoder

Step 1: Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Download the Release
If you don't want to clone the repository, you can download the release from the GitHub repository. Navigate to the repository's release page (https://github.com/nemson-source?tab=packages&repo_name=open-base64-encoder) and download the release file (open-base64-encoder.zip) for your operating system.

Step 3: Extract the Release
Extract the downloaded release file to a directory of your choice. This will create a folder containing the necessary files for the base-64 encoder.

Step 4: Install Required Libraries
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the release files. Run the following commands to install the required libraries: ``
npm install base64-js
npm install fs
npm install readline
``

These commands will install the necessary Node.js libraries (base64-js, fs, and readline) that the encoder relies on.

Step 5: Encode Files
To encode files, run the file_encoder.bat file in the release folder. This will start the Node.js program and prompt you to enter the path, name, and extension of the file you want to encode (e.g., \decoder\decoder.bat). Then, input the output folder with the name and extension of the output file (e.g., \output\output.bat).

Step 6: Decode Files
To decode files, run the file_decoder.bat file in the release folder. This will start the Node.js program and prompt you to enter the path, name, and extension of the file you want to decode (e.g., \output\output.bat). Then, input the output folder with the name and extension of the output file (e.g., \output\decoder.bat).

Step 7: Encode Text
To encode text, run the text_encoder.bat file in the release folder. This will start the Node.js program and prompt you to enter the text you want to encode. Then, input the output folder with the name and extension of the output file (e.g., \output\output.txt).

Step 8: Decode Text
To decode text, run the text_decoder.bat file in the release folder. This will start the Node.js program and prompt you to enter the text you want to decode. Then, input the output folder with the name and extension of the output file (e.g., \output\output.txt).
